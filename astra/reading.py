"""Astra's reading: what she is reading, how far, and what she has made of it.

This module is the *vocabulary and policy* layer for background reading. It owns
no store, no network, no model, and no thread; it is pure functions over plain
data, in the same spirit as :mod:`astra.inquiry`. That keeps the design honest:

* the durable *understanding* of a work is an ordinary memory - observations,
  interpretations, hypotheses and open questions - written through the existing
  store, so it inherits evidence, decay, dormancy, contradiction handling and
  supersession (see ``TripleMemoryStore.apply_reading_results``);
* the *reading progress* (where she is, what she has covered) is a compact
  structured record that this module describes, so it can be persisted
  atomically and resumed without rereading (see :mod:`astra.library`);
* the *decision to read right now* is a deterministic policy over observable
  conditions - Roum is idle, no game is running, the machine is not loaded - so
  the reader wakes only when it is polite to, never on a timer and never by
  guessing the model's mood.

Two boundaries this module deliberately preserves:

* **General knowledge vs work-specific understanding.** Nothing here consults
  the base model's knowledge of a work. Only what Astra actually recorded about
  *this* work, under its own ``work_id``, is ever surfaced.
* **Reason to speak vs speaking.** ``conversation_candidates`` preserves why she
  might want to raise something; it never sends anything. Initiative stays a
  later, explicit decision.

- Keep each item short. Prefer a few real items over many thin ones.
- Also record Astra's own reaction to this passage: what she actually felt or noticed while reading it, and what she was thinking about besides the book. This is her momentary response, not a claim about who she is - do not turn it into a personality trait or a life lesson.
