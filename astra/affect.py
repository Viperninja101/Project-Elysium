"""Astra's current experiential affect.

Where ``relational.py`` holds a *relationship-specific* preference, this module
holds the *experiential* side of Astra's state: how engaged, curious,
concentrated, frustrated, invested, or anticipatory she currently is.

The two use the same accumulator mechanics on purpose, but they are deliberately
NOT merged. A book can leave Astra absorbed without changing how she feels about
Roum, and a blunt turn from Roum can sting without making her less curious. They
are separate records in separate models, and neither reads the other.

Design constraints:

* **Derived, not asserted.** Components move only from *experiences* recorded on
  the live path, never from a prompt build. Nothing here is assigned for the
  sake of making dialogue expressive.
* **Temporary.** This is current state, not memory. It decays toward neutral and
  is never promoted to a durable disposition by itself; that stays the job of
  the existing self-memory evidence gates.
* **Behavioural, not decorative.** The state exists to change *processing* -
  attention and retrieval breadth now, persistence/abandonment once the reading
  and question systems exist. ``prompt_block`` supplies grounded state for the
  model to express in her own words; it never supplies a line to perform.
* **Minimal.** Only dimensions with a concrete behavioural consumer are kept.
  "Uncertainty" is deliberately *not* a number here: it belongs to the question
  system (Slice 2), where it can be represented as something revisable rather
  than as a vague scalar.
